Welcome to astrodbkit's documentation!
======================================

The BDNYC Database is an advanced SQL relational database of published spectra, photometry and astrometry for over 1300 very low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects.

This documentation describes a tool kit of classes, methods and functions useful for CRUD operations and analysis of data from The BDNYC Data Archive.

Getting Started
===============

To install, just do::

    pip install astrodbkit

This package includes the initial release of the BDNYC Database, which contains the astrometry, photometry and spectra for the 198 objects in the `Filippazzo et al. (2015)`_ sample.

.. _Filippazzo et al. (2015): http://adslabs.org/adsabs/abs/2015ApJ...810..158F/

.. note:: For access to the full dataset, an email request must be made to a BDNYC group admin.

Accessing the Database
======================

To start using the database, launch iPython, import the module, then initialize the database with the :class:`astrodb.get_db()` class like so::

    from astrodbkit import astrodb
    db = astrodb.get_db()


Voila! You can see an inventory of all data for a specific source by passing a *source_id* to the :py:meth:`~astrodb.get_db.inventory` method::

    db.inventory(86)

This will also plot all available spectra for that source for visual inspection if you set **plot=True**.

Querying the Database
=====================

Now that you have the database at your fingertips, youâ€™ll want to get some info out of it. To do this, you can pass SQL queries wrapped in double-quotes (") to the :py:meth:`~astrodb.get_db.query` method::

    data = db.query( "SQL_query_goes_here" )

`Here is a detailed post about how to write a SQL query`_.

.. _Here is a detailed post about how to write a SQL query: http://www.bdnyc.org/?p=898

The result of a SQL query is a Numpy array with the data requested from each record. For example, we can get a source's photometry from the PHOTOMETRY table with::

    db.query("select band,magnitude from photometry where source_id=202")

which gives the output::

    np.array([['J', 13.526],['H', 12.807],['Ks', 12.503],['W1', 12.486],['W2', 12.386],['W3', 12.313],['W4', 8.525]])

Alternatively, we can have this data returned as a Python dictionary with::

    db.query("select band,magnitude from photometry where source_id=202", DICT=True)

whose output looks like::

    [{'band': 'J', 'magnitude': 13.526},{'band': 'H', 'magnitude': 12.807},{'band': 'Ks', 'magnitude': 12.503},{'band': 'W1', 'magnitude': 12.486},{'band': 'W2', 'magnitude': 12.386},{'band': 'W3', 'magnitude': 12.313},{'band': 'W4', 'magnitude': 8.525}]
